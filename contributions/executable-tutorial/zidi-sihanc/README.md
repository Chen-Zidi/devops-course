## Proposal

We want to write a toturial on katacoda. 
The idea is about to deploy a php web application using docker. 
Docker is a useful too for CI/CD, which should fit the purpose of the course. 
Since there is no such toturial on katacoda, we want to help to improve.

If there are more suggestions, 
please tell me :)
